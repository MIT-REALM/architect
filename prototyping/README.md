## Architect prototyping

This directory contains prototypes for new Architect functionality, which are often implemented as Jupyter notebooks to help encourage rapid prototyping. There are no code quality controls on code in this directory, so it should be treated as "dumpster-fire-quality" and should probably not be blindly copy-pasted into the rest of Architect. That being said, please feel free to play around with this code as much as you like!
